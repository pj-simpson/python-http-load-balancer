This is the completed code, for the course 'Creating an HTTP Load Balancer in Python' by Neeran Gul. You can find the
course on http://testdriven.io.
Included in the code are the 'take-home' challenges of _weighted_ and _round-robin_ load balancing algorithms.
I achieved the latter using pickle! A naive implementation, but a fun one, none the less!  

I would recommend this course for anyone learning Python web development who is also interested in IAC concepts!
There doesn't seem to be many courses out there like this (certainly not in the Python world), which makes it all
the more interesting.
